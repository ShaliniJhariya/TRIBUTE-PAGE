            <h2>A brief summary of Gandhi's journey</h2>
            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <p>
                Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, which was then part of the British
                Empire.
                Although young Gandhi wanted to become a doctor, his father, who served as a chief minister in
                Porbandar, persuaded him to study law.
                After 3 years of studies in London (where he became a vegetarian), Gandhi came back to India and tried
                to start his career as a lawyer.
